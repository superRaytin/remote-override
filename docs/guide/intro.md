# Why This Extension Exists

### The Idea

The core idea is simple:

> **Let the browser load remote resources as if they were local.**

By defining clear mapping rules, specific online URLs can be redirected to local services directly inside Chrome — without changing servers or affecting other users.


### Typical Use Cases

- **Local API testing and integration** against remote environments
- **Overriding CDN or static resources** for quick validation
- **Debugging third-party scripts** with local copies
- **Investigating production-only issues** safely
- **Managing multiple proxy setups** in large projects


### Who It’s For

This extension is built for developers and testers who need **fast, safe, and repeatable control over web resources** during debugging and development.


### Philosophy

- Browser-only, no system-wide side effects
- Visual and explicit rule definitions
- Focused on real-world frontend workflows

The goal is to provide a lightweight, practical alternative for everyday resource debugging needs.
