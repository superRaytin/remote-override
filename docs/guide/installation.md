# Installation

Remote Override can be installed in two ways, depending on whether you prefer stability or early access to new features.

## Option 1: Chrome Web Store (Recommended)

This is the stable version reviewed by the Chrome Web Store.

- Automatic updates
- Fully reviewed and approved
- Recommended for most users

👉 **[Add to Chrome](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/remote-override/beegiejnndpmaffebpfmcpifhaljjmam)**

## Option 2: Latest Build (Early Access)

Chrome Web Store reviews may take time.  
If you want to try the latest features immediately, you can install the latest build manually.

This option is intended for **developers and advanced users**.

### Download

👉 **[Download latest build (ZIP)](https://github.com/superRaytin/remote-override/releases/latest)**

> This package contains the most recent features that may not yet be available in the Chrome Web Store.

### Manual Installation

1. Download the ZIP package
2. Unzip it to a local directory
3. Open Chrome and go to `chrome://extensions`
4. Enable **Developer mode** (top right)
5. Click **Load unpacked**
6. Select the unzipped directory

The extension will be available immediately.

### Notes

- Developer mode must remain enabled
- Manually installed extensions do **not** auto-update
- Reinstall is required when a new build is released
- Early access builds may change before store approval
